							<p>Problem solving and product design experiences can empower students by presenting unique learning opportunities. Although the problem solving method may have been important to technology education, as well as industrial arts, as far back as the 1920s (Foster, 1994), the movement to incorporate more problem solving and product design in technology education kept surfacing in the 1990s.</p>
							<p>We suggest a different approach to teaching problem solving in technology education. Students should be encouraged to concentrate not on whimsical wants or fanciful products. They should apply their considerable problem solving skills to improving the human condition, and the condition of non-humans, sometimes in spite of what some people want or think they want. They should be encouraged to find solutions from a broad range of technological and non-technological realms. Effective and responsible national leaders and corporate executives are those with enough backbone to do what they believe is best for the nation or corporation, in spite of mass opinion.</p>

									<p><b>WHAT IS PROPELLER DISPLAY..?</b></p>
									<p>Propeller Display is totally based on a moving LEDs row. This LEDs row is rotating at a rate superior to human's eye eminence, making a dot matrix, which seems to float in the air. A motor spins the "propeller" and a small microcontroller keeps track of time and changes the pattern on LEDs with exact timing to simulate array of LEDs. It is an illusion, but it works nicely. There are 2 main types of rotating displays, cylindrical and disk shaped. Whereas cylindrical displays are only capable of displaying text and digits disk shaped displays have the ability to display analog clock hands.</p>

						            <p><b>Problem statement:</b> The objective is to design a 2D “Shoot the enemy plane” game using a self-fabricated LED Matrix as the display and the game will be played by buttons/ self-fabricated handheld joystick.</p>
						            <p><b>Compulsory Task:</b> The teams need to implement following:</p>
						            <ul>
						            	<li>A self-fabricated LED matrix of minimum size 8x8 will be used for display. A particular pattern of glowing LEDs should be used to represent the player’s plane.</li>
						            	<li>One can either use an accelerometer or tilt switches to move the controlled plane left or right. Shooting and other functions will be performed by buttons.</li>
						            	<li>Enemy will be represented by a different pattern of glowing LED moving downwards. At least one enemy should be coming at any given time.</li>
						            	<li>The defending plane fires a missile with the press of a button on the joystick, which will be represented by a glowing LED moving away from the plane. When the missile collides with incoming enemy planes, it destroys them.</li>
						            	<li>Aim of the game is to protect the controlled planes from colliding with the enemy planes by destroying or evading them, as long as possible. Any other extra feature can also be implemented.</li>
						            </ul>

						            <p>“Technology and business are becoming inextricably interwoven. I don’t think anybody can talk meaningfully about one without talking about the other”- Bill Gates</p>
						            <p>Technology in business is a growing necessity. As the years go by, the business world is leaning more and more toward it, making it almost impossible to separate the two from each other. Innovation breeds business, and since technology paves the way for it, it can be gathered here that business needs technology to be sustained. In modern times, one cannot succeed only with his technological skill.  Technology amalgamated with entrepreneurship skills has become a vehicle that facilitates prosperity in individuals, firms, regions, and nations.</p>				            
						            <p>Keeping up this spirit, ECDC this year presents to you “ELECTRADE” for the first time, where you get a glimpse of how your classroom education when topped with a pinch of entrepreneurial skills can make you the front-runner of the business. This is a multiple round “on the spot” event, in which 1st round is a theoretical MCQ test based on electronics and every correct answer earns the participant a virtual money. Using this money participants will move to further rounds, where they will buy components and make the listed electronic circuits in a given time. Once a team completes a circuit, it can then sell the circuit, in return of more virtual money. A team can again buy new components and build a new circuit and sell it to earn more money. The team which has the maximum money at the end of predefined time will be considered as the winner.</p>

						        	Saturated with the world of basic ICs and microcontrollers and in quest to give yourself a challenge worth your intelligence? Techkriti '15 presents FPGA Design Challenge, for the electronic elite, who love to unravel the mysterious of the black box! It is a platform to utilize academic skills in an interesting, innovative fashion so that being "nerdy" becomes the new fashion trend! 
						        	</p>
						        	<p>Field-programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit which can be configured by the user which provides it a major advantage over MCUs which have a fixed configuration. This enables the user to implement any digital circuit (YES! EVEN A PROCESSOR) on FPGA. The FPGA configuration is generally specified using a hardware description language like Verilog. Here, we invite you to find your way through Field Programmable Gate Arrays, beat the odds with your intelligent code, and prove your edge over the rest of the world!</p>

						        		<p>Embedded Design Challenge, differentiates the people with "just interest" in electronics from the ones who are "passionate" about it. The event is designed to be accessible to new learners of electronics, yet at the same time pose a stimulating challenge to experienced students.</p>
						        		<p> You might be familiar with many ranging technologies, RADAR ranging technology is one of them which has proved its mettle in modern day warfare. SONAR has been very much useful in exploring deep oceans. There are countless number of applications of ranging technologies.</p>
										<p>Inspired by this ECDC this time gives you an opportunity to build your own ranging device and get the insights of this extremely useful technology. The device uses a simple ultrasonic trans-receiver which scans through an area to produce a 2D map of the area.</p>

						        		<p><b>Obstacle detection and 180o map building with a rotating Ultrasonic range sensor.</b></p>
						        		<p><b>Problem Statement:</b>Make an ultrasound echo based 180 degree rotating ranging device which scans an area and transmit signal wirelessly, to a handheld module which displays the results. The device should be capable of performing following two basic tasks. </p>
						        		<p>Task 1: Plot a 2D map of an arena, which will have cubical obstacles placed at different positions upto a radial distance of 1 meter from the sensor position.</p>
						        		<p>Task 2: Calculate the displacement of an obstacle.</p>
						        		<br>
						        		<p><b>Explanation:</b></p>
						        		<p><b>Task 1</b></p>
						        		<p>
						        			<ul>
						        				<li>The ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo motor will sweep 180o angle.</li>
						        				<li>Distances of Obstacles are detected at different angles of the servo.</li>
						        				<li>This data is sent wirelessly to the other module.</li>
						        				<li>With known angle of servo and distance of obstacle at that angle a 2d Map in polar coordinate system can be plotted.</li>
						        				<li>This map is to be plotted on a GLCD (with proper scaling) so that it can be intuitively perceived.<br>
						        				One can alternatively display results on a computer screen (using visual design languages like Processing etc) via UART communication between the microcontroller and computer.</li>

						        				<li>One can also use 2 or more sweeps and take rolling average of values for better result.</li>
						        			</ul>
						        		</p>
						        		<p><b>Task 2</b></p>
						        		<p>
						        			<ul>
						        				<li>After completion of task 1, teams will proceed to task 2, where there will be only one obstacle on the arena.</li>
						        				<li>After one scan, the system will detect the position of the obstacle and wait for 30sec.</li>
						        				<li>During this time the obstacle will be moved to a new positon.</li>
						        				<li>The system will again scan through the arena and detect the new position of the obstacle.</li>
						        				<li>Using the original and current positions of the obstacle, the displacement of the obstacle is to be calculated.</li>

						            <p>Gameplay consist of two bots from each team coordinating with each other in order to correctly place the boxes on a slab. The objective is to travel over the wedge and then keep the block on the other side of the arena. The other bot is then supposed to lift that block and place them on the slabs. The first bot will move in first half of the arena and is supposed to pick up blocks and travel over the wedge to place the block in the second part of the arena. The second bot will move in the second half the arena and will pick up blocks and will place them on the slabs present in the second half of the arena. A fixed time will be given in which each team has to place as many blocks as possible in their respective slabs.</p>

						           <p>Programming Model: Parallel Programming using MPI (Message Passing Interface)<br>IHPC consists of two phases: <br>
						           In the learning phase, which will be 5 days long, a new problem will be uploaded every day and you can submit your solutions to the problem, so that you familiarize yourself with high performance computing. The solution and explaination will also be uploaded.
						           <br>
						           In the contest phase, a set of problems will be uploaded. Your best submission for a particular problem before the contest ends will be considered as your final submission to compute the rankings.<br>
							       Both these phases will be online, you need NOT come to IIT Kanpur for this event.<br>
								   Teams of at most 3 people are allowed.<br>
								   Ranking will be based on:<br>
								   Firstly, on the number of problems solved.<br>
								   Then, if two teams have solved the same number of problems, the team with smaller sum of execution times will be ranked above.</p>

						           <p>1) Who can participate ? Do I need to know the concepts of Parallel Computing before 
									participating in the contest?<br>
									Anyone can participate. We will be providing you with sufficient resources in the 
									learning phase so that you can learn and then participate.<br><br>
									2) Do I need to come to IIT Kanpur for this event?<br>
									No. The event will be fully online.<br><br>
									3) What are the pre-requisites to participate in this event?<br>
									There are none, but knowing C/C++ would help you in this event.<br><br>
									4) How would I test my solution?<br>
									You would be provided a software which would simulate parallel computing on your 
									personal computers, which could be used to test correctness of your solution. You can 
									get a rough idea of how your code performs on the processors though the actual time 
									would differ on the servers.

						            	<p>Ever wondered how to apply toothpaste on your toothbrush in 20 steps? Ever wondered how to shoot a dart in a jumbled room in 30 steps? You had to think again right? Concatenate is all about complexifying the simplest of things you see around yourself. Its whole essence lies in a perfectly balanced mix of innovation, creativity, relevance which results in profound entertainment.</p>
										<p>Hang on! If you have just started to think you need some extremely geeky wizard or some heavenly gadget to accomplish this challenge, you are mistaken! You just need all the scrap which you find in abundance in the society, like, wasted paper, or the use-and-throw paper cups and plates, the amusing balloons which once gave you enormous pleasure on bursting, cellotape, toilet paper, and alike. The whole motto should be to complete the assigned task most efficiently with the greatest of complexity delivering an extremely entertaining show for the audience.</p>
										<p><b>Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated”, in the words of Confucius.</b></p>
										<p>Here's to the crazy ones. The ones who see things differently. Ones not fond of rules , who are tired of straightforward algorithms. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.It's Time to put on your thinking hats, and come up with all the bizarre and uncanny ideas and innovate, take risks, break rules, make mistakes and have fun.For all day-dreamers and dramatists alike, for whom the world is too mundane – unleash yourselves in The Concatenate Challenge at techkriti'15, where the sole objective is to find the craziest, complicated, convoluted, and "coolest" way to complete a given task.</p>
										<p><b>WHAT DOES IT HAVE FOR YOU?</b></p>
										<p><b>Challenges! </b>Yes, it enables you to learn valuable organizational skills and gain hands-on experience by working on an actual project. Irrespective of your major dimension of study, you innovate, you incubate , you ignite your innovation and put it to test. Additionally, it brings on the table a chance to get an insight into team management and handling stress. Last but not the least, you have some really handsome cash prizes to party harder after you have worked hard!So, let’s explore the endless possibilities of engineering by creating a machine that, in multiple steps, will perform one simple task. Here is a fun <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=qybUFnY7Y8w" target="_blank">video</a> for motivation! Happy building!</p>

						            		<li>Minimum number of members in a team must be 4. However, it must not exceed 6 per team.</li>
						            		<li>The machine must complete the task as described in the challenge. If not, points kept for the same would be deducted.</li>
						            		<li>The machine must be no larger than 12 ft. x 12 ft. x 8 ft. The support from any of the four walls and the top ceiling is not allowed in any form.</li>
						            		<li>The machine must have a minimum of 20 steps (series+parallel).If the machine has less than 20 steps the respective team would be disqualified from the competition. However, there is no constraint on maximum number of steps.</li>
						            		<li>Each parallel step lead to an addition by one in the no. of parallel steps. Each smaller individual energy transfer in parallel step will be added in series steps.  If a step is not completed in final run, it would be deducted from the no. of steps.</li>
						            		<li>Only one member from the team is supposed to explain their machine before the demonstration.</li>
						            		<li>Each team will have a 15 minute reset time if they opt for more than one run.</li>
						            		<li>Only one team member is allowed to interact with the machine once the evaluation has begun. This includes resetting the machine during the run. This means that only one person will be allowed inside the arena. However, if the team goes for another run, the restriction of one person inside the arena is uplifted until the machine is ready for the other run.</li>
						            		<li>Every team must have a leader. But it is not necessary for the leader to give the presentation or handle the machine during machine run.</li>
						            		<li>Any loose/falling/hanging objects must remain within the boundaries of the arena. This includes, but is not limited to, balls, dominoes, drops of water, slivers of balloon, and any other "small" objects. Steam and other gases are exempt from this rule.  However, for the sole purpose of electrical connection wires can be outside the boundaries of the arena.</li>
						            		<li>Each step in the machine should be considered as transfer of energy from one action to another. Identical transfers of energy in succession should be considered one step. For e.g., a set of dominos falling into each other should be considered one step. While technically each single domino falling is a step, stating one hundred steps for hundred dominos is repetitive and against the spirit of Rube Goldberg.</li>
						            		<li>The task should be completed in not more than 4 minutes. Marks will be deducted if time limit exceeds.</li>
						            		<li>No hazardous materials or explosives may be used on or within the machine. However matchsticks can be used to produce fire if necessary provided they do not lead to any damage to the arena and is safe for people around it.</li>
						            		<li>No live animals are allowed in the machine.</li>
						            		<li>Every team will be given maximum three runs for the completion of the task so that if, in case, a team fails to complete the task in their first run, they can go for second run.<br>In the first two runs, the best amongst the two scores will be considered as final. However,if a team uses the third turn only the score in this run would be considered. The previous two turns will be ignored.</li>
						            		<li>For every human intervention, points will be deducted.</li>
						            		<li>Any destructive action against another machine is grounds for disqualification.</li>
						            		<li>Programmable Logic Controllers or any other electronic controller/devices may be used on the machines. The use of these devices must be in line with a step. Using these devices as a fail-safe for the machine is illegal and grounds for disqualification.</li>
						            		<li>Let's say a ball is supposed to fall onto a switch and turn on a motor which is run by the controller.
							            		<ul>
							            			<li>If the ball misses the switch, but the controller still starts the motor, the controller is not transferring energy from one step to the next step. It is acting as fail safe so the machine can finish its task and is not in line with definition of a step.</li>	
							            			<li>If the ball hits the switch and the controller starts the motor as it should, the device is merely transferring the energy from one step to another, so this is line with the definition of a step.</li>
							            		</ul>
						            		</li>
						            		<li>If a controller/electronic device is used, each instance of its operation should be clearly stated in the step-by-step description submitted along with the written description.</li>
						            		<li>Each instance should be considered one step, but please supply detailed information of how the step is being accomplished.</li>

								</div>
								<div id="faqs" class="tab">
									<p><b>Q) Can I participate in multiple events?</b></p>
									<p>A) Yes, you can.</p>

									<p><b>Q) What is qualification time?</b></p>
									<p>A) To participate in any of the main events, you must be able to solve that puzzle in time less than the corresponding qualification time.</p>

									<p><b>Q) Do I need to get the cubes?</b></p>
									<p>A) As per the regulations of WCA you may or may not bring your own cubes. You may choose to borrow from any other participants or the organizers. Although we will be providing good quality lubricated cubes, participants are suggested to use their own cubes as performance with a familiar cube is always likely to be better.</p>

									<p><b>Q) How is the solve time calculated?</b></p>
									<p>A) The solving time is calculated using the stackmat timers. This is a stackmat timer.</p>

									<p><b>Q) Would you consider the average solve time or the best time?</b></p>
									<p>A) In the events having multiple solves for a single event, we would take the average. For other events (blindfolded, multiple blindfolded, fewest moves), the best solve time is considered. For details about how the averages are calculated for each events, check the regulations tab.</p>

									<p><b>Q) What if my cube breaks open during a solve?</b></p>
									<p>A) The participant may stop or continue with the solve. Details on how to continue with the solve are given on the WCA website under Article 5:Puzzle Defects.</p>

									<p><b>Q) What if my cube falls during a solve?</b></p>
									<p>A) You must pick up the cube and start solving from the point where you left. In case of one-handed cubing, you should pick it up with the same hand with which you were solving it.</p>

									<p><b>Q) What happens when my cube touches any body part other than my hands?</b></p>
									<p>A) You are disqualified. In case of one-handed cubing, only the solving hand should touch the cube and any contact from the other hand may also lead to disqualification.</p>

									<p><b>Q) Does memorisation time count in Blindfolded solves?</b></p>
									<p>A) Yes.</p>

									<p><b>Q) Should I remove the Blindfold before or after stopping the timer?</b></p>
									<p>A) Either way is correct. It is just a matter of personal choice. Detailed regulations on Blindfolded cubing are available on the WCA website under Article B.</p>

									<p><b>Q) What happens once I take my Blindfold off?</b></p>
									<p>A) You cannot make any more moves. If the cube is unsolved when you take it off, the solve will be considered as DNF(Did not finish).</p>

										<ol>
											<li>Roll:  Rolls have to be flown normally on a straight line (exception is the avalanche). The roll rate has to be constant and the longitudinal axis of the plane has to go straight. This requires constantly changing rudder and elevator control inputs throughout the roll.</li>
											<li>Inside Loop: A vertical circle entered from straight and erect level flight. A positive pitching movement is used at all points in the loop to draw the circle, so that the aeroplane canopy is pointing inwards.</li>
											<li>Inverted Loop: Vertical loop in which plane remains inverted at start and end of the loop.</li>
											<li>Split-S:The figure starts with a half roll to inverted followed by the second half of a loop downward. This is another maneuver to reverse direction. This does not preserve speed and altitude. In this case it trades altitude for speed. (K=10)</li>
											<li>Hammerhead: 1/4 loop (pull or push) to vertical, as momentum/airspeed decreases, rudder is applied and the aircraft rotates around its yaw axis, the nose falls through the horizon and points towards the ground, a momentary pause is made to draw the vertical down line, and 1/4 loop to level flight. This figure is sometimes called a stall turn which is a misnomer because the aircraft never actually stalls.</li>
											<li>Square loop: This is a variation of the basic loop. The two vertical lines and the horizontal line on top have to be of the same length. The exit line at the bottom has to be at least as long as the other three sides. The quarter loops that connect the four sides have to have the same radius at each corner.</li>
											<li>Humpty-Bump: This starts with a quarter loop followed by a half roll to a vertical climb. A half loop then results in a vertical down-line. The maneuvre completes with another quarter loop to horizontal flight.</li>
											<li>4 Point Roll: The four-point roll (hesitation roll) is a horizontal roll with a brief hesitation at 90, 180 and 270 degrees. You should be able to do a roll without any altitude loss or heading deviation.</li>
											<li>Cuban Eight: Two Half Cuban Eights can be combined to form a Cuban Eight or Lay-down Eight. The two looping parts have to be flown at the same altitude with the same radius. The exit has to be at the same altitude as the entrance to the figure.</li>
											<li>Flat Spin: During spin entry, the plane has to show a stall break, followed by the auto-rotation. The rotation has to stop exactly after the specified number of turns. Once the rotation has stopped, a vertical downline has to be established.</li>
										</ol>
										<p>Spot Landing:(Maximum Points 50, 30, 20)</p>
										<p>After completing the maneuvers proceed for spot landing. The landing zone will be marked on the airstrip. The plane is to touch down precisely in the arena. The better the touchdown greater the marks obtained.</p>
										<p>Arena point distribution:</p>
										<ol>
											<li>Innermost circular region (2m in diameter) will have 50 points.</li>
											<li>Concentric circular region (3m in diameter) will have 30 points.</li>
											<li>Outermost circular region (5m in diameter) will have 20 points.</li>

										<p><b>Introduction:</b></p>
										<p>Technology as they say has made human beings lazy. But technology made us fly like birds, due to which people developed great interest in Aero Modelling. We create a platform for such students to really test their skills through a series of competitions. So far we have kept our reaches to battery controlled planes, but it’s time to get the real feeling of how a real aircraft works i.e. those driven by fuel and engines. So it is one of a kind opportunity to be the part of the only IC Engine plane competition held at a college level in India.</p>

									<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
									<p>Ever thought of making your own rocket that too with a soft drink bottle and pressurized water only. Well guess what, here is your chance, design an innovative water propelled rocket and feel your adrenaline rush.</p>
									<p>This is your chance not only to experience the adventure, but also demonstrate your innovation and intelligence. So put on your thinking caps and start preparing for Impulse. It is not going to be easy, the stakes are high and the masters will be competing. Of course, as you will come to know when you make your first water rocket...this is all about fun. And here is a tip ‘Don’t let your orbit get disturbed’.</p>
								</div>
								<div id="modelspecifications" class="tab">
									<p><b>Model Specifications</b></p>
									<ul>
										<li>Water Rocket and any of its components should be handmade. Readymade models are strictly not allowed.</li>
										<li>Your model can be of any size or shape and can be made of any material. But, it should not damage the arena or hurt any person. If your model is found dangerous, you will not be allowed to participate in the event. Whether or not your model is dangerous that will be decided by the panel of event coordinators.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>You are encouraged to be creative in designing nose cones and fins of water rockets but it is strongly advised not to use any kind of metal sheets in designing these parts.</p>
									<p>The water rocket may contain any of the following mechanisms suitable for different rounds :</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Water Rocket with Parachute mechanism.</li>
										<li>Water rocket with booster mechanism. In this case, participants should ensure that they have proper launchers supporting the launching mechanism.</li>
										<li>Multi-stage rocket for extended time of flight.</li>
										<li>Any other innovative mechanism will be encouraged provided that the material and mechanism used is not harmful or dangerous to any person in the field. In this case the decision of the panel of coordinators will be final and no queries will be entertained in this regard.</li>
										<li>However, it is upon the team to choose what model to use for different rounds according to the mentioned rules.</li>
									</ul>
								</div>
							 	<div id="pointsystem" class="tab">
							 		<p><b>Point System</b></p>
							 		<p>Round 1</p>
							 		<ul>
							 			<li>The arena is divided into 3 regions.</li>
							 			<ul>
							 				<li>Region A holds 100 points.</li>
							 				<li>Region B holds 75 points.</li>
							 				<li>Region C holds 50 points.</li>
							 				<li>NO points will be awarded if the water rocket lands outside region C.</li>
							 				<li>In case water rocket lands on a line between two regions, average of the points for both the regions will be taken as score.</li>
							 				<li>In case water rocket lands on any of the side lines of the outermost rectangle, it will be considered a valid landing but only half the points for region C will be given.</li>
							 			</ul>
							 			<li>The position of the rocket will be the first point of impact of the rocket on the ground.</li>
							 			<li>This round is the qualification round.</li>
							 			<li>In event of any clash of final points a tiebreaker will be held between the concerned teams. The clashing teams will have to go through round 1 until the points differ.</li>
							 			<li>The team with greater score will be awarded superior rank.</li>
							 			<li>Top 15 teams will make their way to the second round.</li>
							 		</ul>
							 		<p>Round 1</p>
							 		<ul>
							 			<li>A stopwatch will be used to measure the time of flight. The duration shall include the time when the rocket is launched and until it touches the ground in the first instance. The time for the motion of the rocket after touching the ground once is not included.</li>
							 			<li>Bonus 8 seconds will be added in the final time for water rocket with boosters or multi-staging. Multi-staging along with boosters will earn12 extra seconds.</li>
							 			<li>However, it must be clearly understood that these bonus time will be awarded only on successful functioning of the mechanisms. This will be judged by the organising authority here.</li>
							 			<li>Successful Functioning for boosters is their (all of them) detachment from the main stage and further propulsion of the main stage after that.</li>
							 			<li>Successful Functioning for multi-stage is the separation of the various stages at different intervals.</li>
							 			<li>The top three teams will be granted certificates and prize money.</li>
							 			<li>All decisions taken by the organizing team will be deemed as final.</li>
							 		</ul>
							 		<p>Tie Breaker</p>
							 		<ul>
							 			<li>Each team will be given three chances out of which best two will be   considered. </li>
							 			<li>Out if the three chances the sum of the two best ranges achieved by the same rocket will be considered.</li>
							 			<li>It is to be noted that in the three trials the same water rocket is to be used.</li>
							 			<li>In case the water rocket breaks before the trials are over then the sum of the trials up to then only will be considered.</li>
							 		</ul>
							 	</div>
							 	<div id="rules" class="tab">
							 		<p><b>Rules :</b></p>
							 		<ul>
							 			<li>In the first round 3 chances will be provided out of which 1st will be a trial. The sum of last two chances will be the counted in the score.</li>
							 			<li>Participants will be allowed to launch their model at most 2 times in second round out of which only 1 will be considered for the final judging. The other one will be considered as a trial.</li>
							 			<li>It is upon the participant to choose the given turn as a trial or official turn mentioning it beforehand. No points will be awarded for the trial.</li>
							 			<li>Only water and air can be used as propellants.</li>
							 			<li>It is compulsory for the participants to bring their own launchers.</li>
							 			<li>A compressor will be provided on the spot for pressurizing the water rocket.</li>
							 			<li>Participants are allowed to use separate models for round one and two but the same model has to be used throughout a given round.</li>
							 			<li>The team will be disqualified in case the bottle bursts while pressurizing and still mounted on the launcher.</li>
							 			<li>The organizers reserve all rights to change any or all of the above rules. Changes will be highlighted on the website and will also be mailed to all the registered participants. However, you are suggested to keep checking the website regularly.</li>

							 		<p><b>Event</b></p>
							 		<p>There will be 3 rounds in the competition:</p>
							 		<ul>
							 			<li>Round 1 : Hovering</li>
							 			<p>This round will test the stability of the rotor.</p>
							 			<p>The controller will be given 1.5 minutes in which he/she has to take off from a starting point and then land the rotor in the given region 8m from the starting point as given in the arena section.</p>
							 			<p>There are 4 regions (i.e. regions formed between the concentric circles):</p>
							 			<ul>
							 				<li>Region A - It is the area covered by the innermost circle which will be of 50 cm in radius.</li>
							 				<li>Region B - It is the region which is enclosed by the square of side 1.5m and the circle with radius 50cm</li>
							 				<li>Region C - It is the region which is enclosed by the circles with radius 125cm and the square of side 1.5 m.</li>
							 			</ul>
							 			<p>Points Distribution:</p>
							 			<ul>
							 				<li>Landing the rotor in:</li>
							 				<ul>
							 					<li> Region A will earn the team with 100 points</li>
							 					<li> Region B will earn 70 points</li>
							 					<li>Region C corresponds to 40 points</li>
							 					<li>Landing outside this circle, a team will not get any point for this round.</li>
							 				</ul>
							 				<li>In case the multirover is landing on more than one region i.e. the line joining the radial points of contacts of the multirover’s body with the ground lies in more than 1 region, the points given to the team will be the average of the scores of the individual regions.</li>
							 				<li>Along with this, the time taken from take-off to the first point of contact on the ground after take-off will be noted(say time is t(sec)) and, (90-t) points will be added to your score in the Round 1.</li>
							 			</ul>
							 			<li>Round 2: Weight Lifting</li>
							 			<p>This round will be testing the power of your rotor.</p>
							 			<p>2 attempts will be given to each team in which they have to lift some weight (to be decided by the team itself) up to a minimum height of 50cm and hold it air-borne for at least 30 seconds, and then make a controlled landing to the ground. The weights will be in the form of plastic bottles which will be filled with water to adjust the weight.</p>
							 			<p>The maximum of the two weights lifted followed by the controlled landing in the 2 trials will be counted as the Payload lifted and winners for this round will be decided on the basis of payload fraction.</p>
							 			<p>Payload fraction is the ratio of the payload to the total weight of the rotor.For example a 1.5Kg model that can lift 3Kg would beat a 20 Kg model that can pick up 35 Kg, because the smaller one has a payload to machine weight ratio of 2.00 and the larger machine has a payload to machine weight ratio of 1.75.</p>
							 			<p>Clarification :</p>
							 			<ul>
							 				<li>Payload Weight: Payload weight is the weight that is additional to the weight of the Multirover in its successful flight. So Payload will be extra weight attached and the weight of Batteries and motors etc. cannot be counted to as the payload. The extra weight will be in the form of bottles filled with water that will be attached through hooks/pouches prepared on the rotor. So in no way the payload will be adding strength to your model.</li>
							 				<li>Machine Weight: In it the weight of batteries and motors etc. will be added to the model weight, means total weight of Multirover will be taken into account which is lifting the payload.</li>
							 			</ul>
							 			<p>Points Calculation:</p>
							 			<p>Score in Round 2 = 100 X payload fraction</p>
							 			<p>*Only Half the points will be given if the minimum height criterion is not fulfilled.</p>
							 			<p>The organizers reserve all rights to change any or all of the above rules. Changes will be highlighted on the website and will also be mailed to all the registered participants. However, you are suggested to keep checking the website regularly.</p>
							 			<li>Round 3: Racing</li>
							 			<p>This round will fill you with thrill and add all the more fun. It will include racing the multirovers around obstacles. The smaller the machine, better will be its manoeuvrability.</p>
							 			<p>Obstacles including poles to go around and gates to pass through will be set up 2m apart in a total length of 10m along the track. The Multirovers, one at a time will line up on the start/finish line and given a chance to spool up the motor to idle condition. Once all the props are spinning and ready, the whistle will sound and the race will start. The multirovers have to cross the starting line and reach the finishing line. Time will be counted from the moment the whistle sounds until the craft touches down on the finishing line. The pilot will be allowed to walk along with their model inside and outside the course to be able to judge the clearance of each of the obstacles.</p>

									Team 29 States, Techkriti' 15 would be happy to provide full reimbursement (to and fro) of Sleeper Class Railway Fares from your college to Kanpur.<br><br>

									'29 States'- This provides a platform to students across the country to change the recent scenarios of problems currently persisting in our country and suggest feasible solutions to the problems of these states.<br><br>
									 The presentations and discussion will be concentrated on a centralized broad theme- <b>"Make in India"</b>.<br><br>
									   This time complete part of India is divided into total of five zones. The main concept is that three students would be selected from each zone and would then be invited to attend the final round in Techkriti'15 (during 19th _  22nd  March 2015) in IIT Kanpur. Each participant will then be given a stage time to put forward their solutions to the problem which would be provided beforehand in front of eminent judges from different governmental as well as non-governmental backgrounds.<br><br>
									   A quite major question now apparent in the society these days is that have we really tried to bring a change in the system that we always wanted? Instead of just saying that 'Is system ka kuch nahi ho sakta', have we even tried to bring a positive change in ourselves? As rightly said by Mahatma Gandhi "Be the change you want to see around you". It is very evident that in order to bring about a change we ourselves need to take a step forward. Techkriti'15 just provides such a platform to these people to come and express themselves in front of the whole country.<br><br>
									   The participants will be evaluated through a preliminary round. This Round is the submission of an online questionnaire followed by some short answer question in which the general awareness of the participants was tested. Also a short essay is to be submitted by participants to express their views. The spectacular event will conclude with a panel discussion in which the judges and all the participants would actively take part to bring out the best possible solution out of the numerous innovative solutions provided.<br><br>

						            <p>3D Printing is a revolutionary way of building things layer by layer. The biggest advantage that this technology provides is the ability to build highly complex objects and manufacturing bespoke objects in a cost effective manner. All we need to build things using 3D printing is a 3D model and a 3D Printer.</p>
						            <p>Now this is where you step in. If you’re a 3D designer, here is an opportunity for you to build a design for 3D Printing and have it 3D Printed for yourself for free while also getting some great prizes!</p>
						        </div>
						        <div id="pstate" class="tab">
						            <p>Entries are invited in the two categories listed below:</p><br>
						            
						            <p><b>Memes</b></p>
						            <p>For the past couple of years, memes have emerged as the de facto language of the internet. We’ve all been seeing the 2 Dimensional versions of these memes, but here’s an opportunity for you to build a few 3D memes. The model should not be more than 3 inches in height and should be based on an already popular internet meme.</p><br>

						            <p><b>Phone covers</b></p>
						            <p>Everyone wants their phone covers to be unique and different. With 3D printing, we can build things that areunique in the true sense of the word. Phone covers are to be designed for one or more of the following phones:
						            <br>
						            Moto G (1st Gen)<br>
									Moto G (2nd Gen)<br>
									Moto X (1st Gen)<br>
									Moto X (2nd Gen)<br>
									iPhone 6<br>
									iPhone 6 Plus
						            </p>
							    </div>
						        <div id="design" class="tab">
									<p><b>Memes:</b></p>
									<p>All designs submitted to this competition will have to be designed for full colour sandstone 3D Printing. Special care would have to be taken to ensure optimum wall thickness and the presence of escape holes. More detailed instructions about designing for full coloured sandstone can be found <a href="#">here</a></p><br>
									<p><b>Phone covers:</b></p>
									<p>The base models for each of these phone covers can be downloaded here. You may choose to build upon these base models or start from scratch, but please ensure that the dimensions are accurate. The models will be manufactured using industry grade plastic. More detailed instructions about designing for plastics can be found here.</p>
						        </div>

						        <div id="rules" class="tab">
						        	<ul>
						        		<li>The design should be your original work and you should own the rights to distribute the design.</li>
						        		<li>All designs found to have been taken from the internet will be disqualified.</li>
						        		<li>One participant can submit more than one design but only the best design for each participant would be considered for prizes.</li>
						        		<li>All designs will have to be uploaded on <a href="http://www.myobjectify.com">www.myobjectify.com</a> with the Tag "Techkriti14". You may add more tags apart from this, but only models with the "Techkriti14" tag will be considered for judging.</li>
						        	</ul>
						        	<p>The judging criteria for the designs would be as follows:</p>
						        	<p>Utility: 20%</p>
						        	<p>Design Aesthetics: 20%</p>
						        	<p>Originality: 20%</p>
						        	<p>Number of “Likes” on MyObjectify: 20%</p>
						        	<p>3D Printability: 20%</p>
						        </div>

						        <div id="faqs" class="tab">
						        	<p>Q.) Is 3D Printing something like paper printing?</p>
						        	<p>A.) No. The word “3D Printing” is a misnomer. It is a manufacturing process which allows us to build actual things. 3D Printing builds objects using the additive approach where material is added layer by layer instead of the usual process of removing material from a chunk of raw material. </p>
						        	<p>Q.) What software can I use to design these things?</p>
						        	<p>A.) All CAD software such as Solidworks, 3ds Max, Blender, etc. which allow you to design 3D objects and can be used. Please ensure that the final design can be exported in .VRML (for sandstone) or .STL (for plastic) format.</p>
						        	<p>Q.) What formats should the design be submitted in?</p>
						        	<p>A.) The designs should be uploaded in .VRML format for memes and in .STL format for phone covers.</p>
						        	<p>Q.) What is the material that will be used?</p>
						        	<p>A.) The 3D memes will be built in full colour sandstone and the phone cases will be built using industry grade polymers such as Nylon, PLA, ABS, etc.</p>
						        	<p>Q.) I already have a few cool designs, can I submit them?</p>
						        	<p>A.) If they fit into one of the two categories specified and if you own the rights to those designs, go ahead!</p>
						        	<p>Q.) Can I submit more than one entry?</p>
						        	<p>A.) Yes. But only your best entry would be considered for the prize in each competition. In other words, you cannot get more than one prize in each category, but uploading more designs will definitely increase your chances of getting that prize.</p>

						            <p>From the time in the early Stone Age, when human discovered fire for the first time, to this day, when he is trying to reach the frontiers of the universe, human being has never stopped in his pursuit of exploring the mysteries of nature and beyond, applying logical reasoning to understand them and bringing them to his use. Fuelled by the inner fire of curiosity combined with inherent genius, man has been regularly crossing new frontiers into the uncharted territories of science and technology. This unassailable spirit of human intellect and inquisitiveness is what makes humans, the greatest discoverers of all time.
						            </p>
 
									<p>AISRC in Techkriti'15 aims at tapping this infinite potential of human mind to generate an idea, which when given a proper platform, can transform into a path breaking discovery. We invite you to bring forth such original ideas and present it in a genuine and comprehensive way. The idea may be anything ranging from a new method of drying coconut to an ingenious technique of harnessing solar power from satellites floating above our heads.
									</p>
 
									<p>It’s time to think “out of the box”. Let the budding Einstein inside you take over, fire up your grey matter, and show the world what you are capable of.
									</p>

									<p>AISRC presents you a wonderful platform where you can showcase your innovative ideas in form of a research paper, model, prototype, patent, cool apps or any software product in front of a elegant Panel of Judges.</p>

										<h2>1. Energy</h2>
											<p>My position is perfectly definite. Gravitation, motion, heat, light, electricity and chemical action are one and the same object in various forms of manifestation. 
											</p>
										<h2>2. Computing</h2>					            
											<p>Part of the inhumanity of the computer is that, once it is competently programmed and working smoothly, it is completely honest.
											</p>
										<h2>3.  Environment</h2>
											<p>What's the use of a fine house if you haven't got a tolerable planet to put it on?
											</p>
										<h2>4. Healthcare</h2>
											<p>The art of medicine consists of amusing the patient while nature cures the disease.
											</p>
										<h2>5. Advanced Materials</h2>
											<p>The cosmos is within us. We are made of star-stuff. We are a way for the universe to know itself.
											</p>
										<h2>6. Nano Science</h2>
											<p>Man masters nature not by force but by understanding. This is why science has succeeded where magic failed: because it has looked for no spell to cast over nature
											</p>
										<h2>7. Miscellaneous</h2>
											<p>Reasearch is not limited not by any category. If your work does not fall into these category here is the region you need to land.
